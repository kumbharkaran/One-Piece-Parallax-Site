                <p>  Monkey D. Luffy , also known as "Straw Hat" Luffy, is a fictional character and the protagonist 
                     of the One Piece manga series, created by Eiichiro Oda. Luffy made his debut as a young boy who
                     acquires the properties of rubber after accidentally eating one of the Devil Fruits that 
                     belonged to “Red Hair” Shanks.
                    <br><br>
                    'Monkey D. Luffy is the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates, and dreamt of being a pirate 
                    since childhood from the influence of his idol and mentor Red-Haired Shanks. At the age of 17, 
                    Luffy sets sail from the East Blue Sea to the Grand Line in search of the legendary treasure, 
                    One Piece, to succeed Gol D. Roger as "King of the Pirates"
                    <br><br>
                    He fights multiple antagonists, and aids and befriends the inhabitants of 
                    several islands on his journey. Usually cheerful, he becomes serious and even aggressive when 
                    he fights. Luffy uses his rubber body to concentrate his power, executing a range of attacks.
                    In his signature attack, the Gum-Gum Pistol, he slingshots punches at opponents from a distance. 
                    Luffy also grows stronger over the course of the story by gaining different gears as in stronger
                    powers as reflected in his "bounty", which is used to measure the threat he poses to the World 
                    Government. He is the grandson of Monkey D. Garp, who is a vice-admiral of the Navy; the son 
                    of Monkey D. Dragon, who is the leader of the Revolutionary Army, and sworn brother of 
                    Portgas D. Ace and Sabo.

                <p class="text-size">Roronoa Zoro, also known as "Pirate Hunter" Zoro, is a main combatant of the 
                    Straw Hat Pirates, one of their two swordsmen, one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet,
                    and is publicly recognized as the right-hand man of his crew's captain Monkey D. Luffy. Formerly
                    a bounty hunter, he is the second member of Luffy's crew and the first to join it, doing so in the Romance
                    Dawn Arc.
                    <br><br>
                    Born in the East Blue, Zoro is the son of Tera and Roronoa Arashi, the grandson

                    making him a matrilineal descendant of both the Shimotsuki Family of Wano Country and 
                    the legendary samurai, Shimotsuki Ryuma. As a master of Three Sword Style, a swordsmanship 
                    style which he created during his childhood training in Shimotsuki Village, Zoro is one of the

                    as the "Monster Trio". His dream is to become the greatest swordsman in the world, 
                    in order to honor a promise he made to his deceased childhood friend Kuina.

                <p>Usopp, also known by his monikers Sogeking and 
                    "God" Usopp, is a fictional character in the One Piece franchise created by 
                    Eiichiro Oda. He serves as the sniper of the Straw Hat Pirates.
                    <br><br>
                    He was the fourth member to join Luffy's crew and the third officially after 
                    the confrontation they had with Captain Kuro. His dream is to become a great pirate
                     like his father Yasopp, member of the Red-Haired Pirates of "Red-Haired" Shanks.
                    <br><br>
                    Usopp is recognizable for his long nose, a reference to the fact that he tends 
                    to lie a lot. He is a gifted inventor, painter, and sculptor. 
                    In combat, he relies primarily on slingshots to fire various kinds of ammunition 
                    with great precision in coordination with a set of lies and other weapons giving 
                    him a unique fighting style named "The Usopp Arsenal". To help the Straw 
                    Hats rescue Nico Robin, he achieves notoriety under his alter-ego "Sogeking, the King 
                    of Snipers" , a hero sniper wearing a 
                    golden mask and cape. Usopp’s declaration of war on the World Government flag is cited by 
                    fans and critics alike as one of the best moments of One Piece. Eventually, after helping 
                    the Straw Hats liberate Dressrosa from Don Quixote Doflamingo's rule, he becomes infamous as
                    "God" Usopp due to freeing thousands of people from lives
                    as slave toys, as well as light shining from 
                    above onto Usopp whilst underground as he addressed the people he freed.

                    as an adult. After fleeing the Vinsmokes as a child, he eventually entered the care of Zeff as the sous 
                    chef of the Baratie, where he would remain until he met Monkey D. Luffy, who convinced him to join his crew.
                    <br><br>
                    His dream is to find the rumored chef's paradise, All Blue, which is where East Blue, West Blue, North Blue,

                    franchise created by Eiichiro Oda. She is based on Ann and Silk, two characters from Oda's 
                    previous manga Romance Dawn. She is introduced as a thief and pickpocket who possesses 
                    cartographical, meteorological, and navigational skills. At first, she is a subordinate 
                    of the fishman Arlong, but she is eventually freed of this service and permanently joins M
                    onkey D. Luffy to fulfill her dream of creating a complete map of the world.
                    In the series, Nami is the Straw Hat Pirates' navigator, who dreams of drawing a map of the 
                    entire world. Despite her initial distrust of pirates, Nami eventually changes her mind after 
                    being around Luffy and the rest of the crew. Nami is depicted as an intelligent girl who is 
                    obsessed with obtaining money. She is able to use her three-sectioned staff and her climate 
                    skills to create powerful attacks; the most prominent of these staff weapons is the Clima-Tact, 
                    in which she manipulates the climate to create weather-based attacks.
                    <br><br>
                    She was formerly a member of the Arlong Pirates and initially joined the 
                    Straw Hats so that she could rob them in order to buy back her village from Arlong.
                    However, she legitimately joined the Straw Hats after they rebelled against and defeated Arlong.
                     Her dream is to make a map of the entire world.

                    The character made her first appearance in the 114th chapter of the series, which 
                    was first published in Japan in Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine on November 22, 1999.
                    <br><br>
                    In the series, Robin is introduced as an antagonist, but eventually becomes the seventh 
                    member of the Straw Hat Pirates crew, captained by Monkey D. Luffy. Acting as the group's

                    One Piece with the ability to read the ancient stones called Poneglyphs, something considered threatening
                    by the World Government, which forbids the practice.

                    Robin has become extremely popular and a breakout character in anime and manga fandom.
